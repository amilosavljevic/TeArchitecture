# TODOs

* Create Demo2 that is using C# Task instead of ITask.
* Modify Task to hold additional data (like IError)
* Try to create a View that you can use without Unity.
* Try to import projects in Unity.
* Work on UI fixes
* Kill HandlerCode IDs, Request to response type etc. Maybe resourect HandlerCode from somewhere?

# Questions
- Exception that is not thrown instead of IError for Task?

# Ideas

# Technical exploration

- Check how can we back-port C# 8.0 features to .netStandar2.0
