# TODOs

### Handlers
* Try to split validation from execution.
* Action is request; maybe add: Query and Validation too?
* Implement YouthAcademy in new way.

### UI
* MVVM base
* Try to create a View that you can use without Unity.
* Try to import projects in Unity.
* Photoshop exporter + auto-bind

### Misc
* Kill HandlerCode IDs, Request to response type etc. Maybe resourect HandlerCode from somewhere?

# Questions
